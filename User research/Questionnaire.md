# Introduction

PaLM (Patient Like Me) is a web-based platform designed to assist physicians in making informed decisions about treatment plans by providing them with access to similar patient cases. In today's complex medical landscape, physicians often encounter cases that may require alternative or less common treatment approaches. PaLM aims to simplify this process by offering a user-friendly search platform that quickly and efficiently presents relevant, similar patient cases, empowering physicians to make better treatment decisions.

For example, a physician treating a patient with a rare autoimmune disorder may struggle to determine the most effective treatment plan due to limited experience with the condition. By using PaLM, the physician can input the patient's characteristics, such as age, gender, medical history, diagnosis, and treatments, into the platform. PaLM then presents a list of comparable cases, showcasing the treatments and outcomes of patients with similar conditions. This information helps the physician assess the potential success of various treatment options, ultimately leading to better patient care.

> This user research questionnaire is designed to gain valuable insights into the current methods of searching for and comparing similar patient cases, as well as the doctors` expectations for a platform like PaLM. By understanding your challenges and preferences, we can tailor PaLM's features and functionality to better serve your needs as a medical professional.
