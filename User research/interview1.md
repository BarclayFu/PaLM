1. The disease itself is relatively rare in daily life, but many patients, especially the elderly, usually have a variety of chronic diseases, or even chronic diseases may lead to new symptoms, increasing the difficulty of diagnosis and medication, and difficult to determine the treatment plan.
2. I usually look for similar cases in the discharged cases, or ask the superior doctor
3. Maybe 5, although the number of our hospital sample is large, it is not possible to retrieve cases according to the type of disease, let alone the characteristics of patients in detail
4. Comprehensive case comparisons, integration with Electronic Health Records, customizable search criteria, these are really clinical needs, However, if we can expand the consultation records of this case, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of several proposed plans at that time, we can better understand why the final treatment plan was adopted
5. Every patient will have a formatted admission record in the hospital, including basic information such as genetic disease, underlying disease and age. It would be better if a similar template could be established for comprehensive comparison
6. Itâ€™s helpful to get a detailed record of the entire course of disease, such as reasons for medication and medication changes, all test reports such as blood and imaging, and preferably the patient's prognosis within a year after discharge
7. Needless to say, very important
8. In my opinion, all majors should be needed at present, and every major has rare cases, so academic exchanges and reference are particularly important. I am currently working in the department of Obstetrics and gynecology, and the generation and treatment of gynecological tumors is still a difficult problem, so this platform will provide great help
