# Prototype “Patients Like Mine” (PaLM) overview.

The goal of this project is to build an interactive prototype web-based interface for a clinical decision support system that will rely upon electronic health records to help family medicine providers obtain information about treatment pathways and outcome distributions in cases when clinical guidelines are not available or not applicable. As we envision, the system would work in the following way: physician submits a request and specifies parameters that are important for a given patient, using a web interface. The Informatics team along with clinical experts translates this request into logical queries that result in a cohort of patients with similar characteristics and a distribution of outcomes that physician is interested in. Results are returned to the provider in the form of a report that summarizes results (the use of ChatGPT or similar technology can be tested for this task!) and statistical breakdown of the outcomes of interest.
